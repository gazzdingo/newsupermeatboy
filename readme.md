== Disclaimer ==
This game is a homage to Super Meat Boy. It was not made by Team Meat. 
It was made by seven guys in less than one day. 
It’s buggy, it’s unpolished, it’s unfinished. Still: Enjoy. =D

== About the game ==
This game is to Super Meat Boy what New Super Marios Bros was to Super Mario Bros; 
a multiplayer re-imagination of the game in 2.5D. 
We created the game from scratch in Unity. 
You can find the source code on Github – it’s under the MIT license.
